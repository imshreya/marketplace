Assumptions
1. Repayments will be paid every month as EMIs until the total amount is recovered.
2. Lump sum amounts can be paid at any point of time before the end of tenure.
3. The EMI amount will be always ceiled to the nearest integer. For example 86.676767 can be ceiled to 87 and 100.10 to 101.
4. The no of EMIs should be ceiled to the nearest whole number. For example 23.79 will be ceiled to 24 and 23.1 will also be ceiled to 24.
5. If the last EMI is more than the remaining amount to pay, then it should be adjusted to match the amount remaining to pay.
	 E.g. if the remaining amount to pay is 150 and your EMI is 160, then the last EMI amount paid should be 150.
6. The total amount remaining at any EMI number should always include the EMIs paid and lump sum payments until that number. 
	For example if there was a lump sum payment after EMI number 10, then the balance command for EMI number 10 should include the lump sum payment as well.
